React Internship Assignment
⚠️ AI Usage Warning
IMPORTANT: Most submissions we receive are AI-generated. Core application logic must NOT be AI-generated. AI-generated submissions will be rejected immediately.

Overview
Build a React application with a data table that displays artwork data from the Art Institute of Chicago API with server-side pagination and persistent row selection.

Required Resources
API Endpoint: https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=1

UI Component: PrimeReact DataTable

Data Fields to Display
title

place_of_origin

artist_display

inscriptions

date_start

date_end

🛠️ Technical Requirements
1. Project Setup
✅ Use Vite to create the React app

✅ Use TypeScript (JavaScript submissions will be rejected)

2. Data Table Implementation
✅ Implement using PrimeReact DataTable (link) component

✅ Fetch and display data from page 1 on initial load

Use this API to fetch Data: https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=1

✅ Display all required fields in the table





3. Server-Side Pagination
✅ Implement pagination controls

✅ Fetch data from API whenever user changes page

✅ Must use server-side pagination (fetch data per page, not all at once)





4. Row Selection
✅ Add checkboxes for row selection

✅ Allow selecting/deselecting individual rows

✅ Allow selecting/deselecting all rows on current page

✅ Implement custom row selection panel

An Overlay panel which allows user to custom select n number of rows through input field (see the video below for custom selection overlay panel).





5. Persistent Selection
✅ Selected/deselected rows must persist when navigating between pages

❌ Do not fetch rows from other pages and store the objects or ids in a variable in order to select rows from other pages.

Instead, implement a strategy to handle selection and deselection of rows. 

✅ Example: If you select rows on page 1, switch to page 2, then return to page 1, those rows should still be selected

Watch the video below to see Persistent Selection in action.





⚠️ Checks Before Submission
If user selects rows more than the available rows in the current page through custom Row Selection, then you must not pre fetch next (other) page rows and store them in a variable.

This is to prevent prefetching of pages in advance, which can slow down the application and also may lead to out of memory issue.

Instead, you must implement a strategy to handle custom row selection and deselection for rows across different page.

Any submission with this issue is instantly discarded.

A logic snippet is shared below that is very common in most of the submission which has this issue. Avoid implementing logic which calls multiple API or stores other page rows in a variable 

// YOU MUST NOT USE THIS (OR SIMILAR) LOGIC IN YOUR PROJECT
const handleCustomRowSelection = async (): Promise<void> => {
    const count = parseInt(selectCount);
    
    if (!count || count <= 0) {
      alert('Please enter a valid number');
      return;
    }

    const newSelectedIds = new Set<number>();
    const newDeselectedIds = new Set<number>();
    let collected = 0;
    let currentPage = 1;

    while (collected < count) {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(
          `https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks?page=${currentPage}`
        );
        const data: ApiResponse = await response.json();
        
        const needed = count - collected;
        const toSelect = data.data.slice(0, needed);
        
        toSelect.forEach(artwork => {
          newSelectedIds.add(artwork.id);
          collected++;
        });
        
        if (toSelect.length < needed && data.data.length < rowsPerPage) {
          break;
        }
        
        currentPage++;
        
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching artworks for bulk selection:', error);
        break;
      }
    }

    setSelectedRowIds(newSelectedIds);
    setDeselectedRowIds(newDeselectedIds);
    setShowOverlay(false);
    setSelectCount('');
  };

💡 Key Points to Remember
No mass data storage - Only store current page data

Always fetch from API - Even for previously visited pages

Track selections separately - Store row IDs/keys of selected items, not entire row objects

Test thoroughly - Navigate between pages multiple times and verify selection persistence
